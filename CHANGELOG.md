## v6.85.1 (2026-07-13) — SECURITY

- **Path traversal in hot-context (introduced in 6.85.0, fixed before any real use).**
  `project` arrives from an HTTP query/body and was interpolated straight into a
  filesystem path (`path.join(PROJECTS_ROOT, project, 'CHECKPOINT.md')`), so
  `project=".."` / `"../../.ssh"` escaped the projects root — an arbitrary-file-read.
  Caught by the automated commit security review.
  - New `safeProjectDir()`: shape check (single dir name, no separators) AND path
    containment (resolve, then prove it is still under the root). A shape check alone
    is insufficient — `".."` matches `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`.
  - Enforced at BOTH the service entry points (`getHot`, `recomputeHot`) and the route
    boundary (`GET /intellect/hot`, `POST /intellect/hot/recompute`).
  - Verified: 7 traversal vectors (incl. URL-encoded `%2e%2e%2f` and nested
    `ymc.capital/../../.ssh`) all rejected with 400; legitimate projects unaffected.

## v6.85.0 (2026-07-13)

- **Universal memory R1 — hot context (the warm session bootstrap).** Implements the
  council-ratified design in `planning/porter-universal-memory-37.md` (codex + grok).
  Every session (claude, codex, grok, antigravity) currently re-derives the same project
  state from zero, burning tokens to rediscover what the last session already knew.
  - `hot_contexts` table (0103): ONE row per (scope, project) — Porter DB is the source of
    truth; any vault file is a generated mirror.
  - `services/intellect/hot-context.ts`: composes a hard-capped (~900 token) warm packet —
    where we got to (CHECKPOINT.md latest), recent sessions, and POINTERS to drill into.
    Pointers, not payloads.
  - `GET /api/v1/intellect/hot?project=` — warm packet, or an honest COLD response on a
    fresh install (never fabricates history; the CLI still boots fine).
  - `POST /api/v1/intellect/hot/recompute` — force a rebuild.
  - **The de-risking hook:** `POST /session-end` (already gateway-aware) now recomputes hot
    as the ONE default write path — so any CLI ending a session warms the cache for
    whichever CLI opens next, and memory can't be polluted by ad-hoc writes.
  - Verified: cold→warm transition; 192-token packet; a `codex_cli` session-end warmed the
    context that a `claude_cli` session reads. Fail-open throughout.

## v6.48.0 (2026-07-06) — admin revamp: remove Forge/Email/skill-feedback

- feat(admin): removed the Forge, Email, and Skill-Feedback screens from the Porter admin (their backends were already deleted — Forge v6.28.0, mail-pillar purge 2026-07-04 — so these were dead frontends). Route files + nav entries + backend/src/routes/admin/email.ts removed; deregistered. tsc 0, react-router build clean (no orphan chunks). Net −2067 lines.
- Design doc for the replacements (vault: porter-admin-revamp.md): MCP management, tools consolidation, and a CLI config view (Porter visualises ~/.claude config). Those land as follow-up releases.

## v6.47.0 (2026-07-06) — Bridge model failover

- feat(bridge): FAILOVER CHAIN (Moe: "bridge should be switching tom into other models... if claude fails or quota is reached. right now he just breaks"). Every /agent-message dispatch now runs through `dispatchWithFailover`: on gateway failure — process error, timeout, or a quota/usage-limit signature — the SAME task retries on the next gateway in the configured chain (claude_cli → codex_cli → antigravity_cli; env PORTER_BRIDGE_FALLBACK_CHAIN or gateways.priority is the config). Shared 300s budget across the chain (raceBudget). `fallback:false` opts a caller out (hard-fail, no model switch). Loopback-only `simulateFailure` proof hook. The failover chain + per-attempt outcome/reason + who answered persist to bridge_dispatch_log.failover and surface in the response envelope (failover.switched/answeredBy). Proven live: simulate claude_cli fail → codex_cli answered; fallback:false → clean hard-fail; log recorded.
- Covers all Bridge consumers (Tom workers, digests, Marshall/Sentinel, ops-chat, vault-chat, evolution loop). Tom's live WhatsApp chat runs in openclaw's own gateway (not Bridge) — its chat-surface failover lands with the openclaw upgrade.

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Creating a project should trigger an intelligent flow that assigns agents, builds a plan, and starts work with minimal user input
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 5 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-20 — Roadmap created, all 24 v1 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Gradual monolith split — new features in Fastify/TypeScript, existing migrated opportunistically
- [Init]: Project flow is first priority — everything else layers on top of the guided wizard
- [Init]: Memory V2 must be completed and Cortex fully removed before wizard ships
- [Init]: UI-01 (CSS audit) assigned to Phase 1 foundation — discrete deliverable, not a floating concern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: porter.py is ~900KB — Edit tool silently fails on it. All patches must use Python scripts at /tmp/patch_*.py
- [Phase 1]: 683 broad exception catches and 4 bare `except: pass` — bare ones catch SystemExit/KeyboardInterrupt, highest priority
- [Phase 3]: 35 Playwright tests must stay green throughout all route migrations — run after each vertical slice
- [Phase 5]: Wizard prompt engineering (3-question max, agent proposal format) flagged for research during planning

project: porter
version: v6.3.0
updated: 2026-04-09
updated_by: claude-opus-4.6

## Architecture

Single monorepo (heymoezy/porter). One Fastify process on :3001. API metering business model.
3 pillars: Bridge (hub), Forge (factory), Recall (shared brain).
5 gateways: Claude CLI, OpenClaw, Ollama, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI.
**Port 5175 is DEAD. Everything on :3001.**

## v6.3.0 — Complete Data Surface Coverage

Every database table now has a corresponding admin UI page. Zero hidden data.

### All Admin Pages (13 new in v6.2-6.3)
1. `/costs` — Cost analytics (by gateway/model/agent/project, daily chart, dispatches)
2. `/battles` — Battle Arena (matches, leaderboard, agent bonds)
3. `/decisions` — Decision Log (agent reasoning, alternatives)
4. `/sessions` — Session Registry (token budgets, context sizes)
5. `/msg-bus` — Message Bus (agent-to-agent comms)
6. `/env-tools` — Environment Tools (detected capabilities)
7. `/learnings` — Session Learnings (extracted knowledge)
8. `/calendar` — Calendar Events (Google Calendar sync)
9. `/forge-runs` — Forge Pipeline (station runs, quality scores, costs)
10. `/routing` — Routing History (decisions, feedback scores, confidence)
11. `/customer-scores` — Customer Scoring (health/churn/LTV/viral)
12. `/skill-feedback` — Skill Feedback (positive/negative/correction tracking)
13. Skills page gained Proposals + History tabs (evolution merged in)

### Holistic Connections
- All pages cross-linked (agents→detail, gateways→bridge, skills→skills, users→detail)
- Bridge links to costs + sessions
- System links to sessions + msg-bus + decisions
- Forge links to battles + evolution + pipeline
- Billing links to costs
- Dashboard shows real dispatch feed + real projects (all seed data removed)

### Navigation Structure (v6.3.0)
- Dashboard
- Projects: Projects
- Business: Customers, Scores, Revenue, Costs, Calendar
- Agents: Forge, Pipeline, Org Chart, Email, Battle Arena, Skill Feedback
- Ops: Bridge, Routing, Recall, Message Bus, Sessions, Decisions, Mail Ops, Watchers, Approvals, Decomposition, Intelligence, System
- Dev: Env Tools, Learnings, Design System, Architecture

### Consolidation Done
- Evolution merged into Skills (3 tabs: Studio | Proposals | History)
- Dead redirect files deleted (skills-redirect, tools-redirect)
- Fake seed data removed from dashboard (50+ lines)

## Previous Work
- v6.0-v6.1: Orchestration Platform (8 phases)
- Mail system: 13 tranches (full SMTP via Stalwart)

## Email/JMAP Wiring (2026-04-06)

Fully functional webmail backed by Stalwart JMAP:
- DKIM DNS record live (default._domainkey.askporter.app)
- SPF + DKIM + DMARC all configured
- New `jmap-client.ts` — typed JMAP HTTP client for Stalwart
- All mail read endpoints (folders, threads, messages) wired to JMAP
- Message actions (read, archive, trash, delete) via JMAP Email/set
- Sending: nodemailer for simple, JMAP EmailSubmission for attachments
- Attachment upload/download via Stalwart blob API
- Frontend: file picker in compose, attachment chips, download links
- 12 mailboxes operational (porter, postmaster, anvil, atlas, etc.)

Key detail: Stalwart requires `Host: mail.askporter.app` header for JMAP routing.

## Porter Intellect — Phase 1 SHIPPED (2026-04-09)

**What Porter IS:** Not a UI, not an admin panel. Porter is the invisible intelligence
that sits behind every CLI session, watches, learns, validates memory, and evolves.
The admin is for observability. Real product = the autonomous brain.

**Three Pillars:**
- **Brain** = what Porter knows (memory: directives, concepts, project notes, agent notes, episodes)
- **Bridge** = how Porter acts (routing + dispatch + protocol selection — already partial)
- **Intellect** = how Porter gets smarter (NEW — analysis, validation, pruning, evolution)

**Phase 1 Complete — Foundation:**
- Schema: episodes, memory_references, intellect_events, workflows tables
- Memory extensions: references_json, verified_at, supersedes_id on all memory tables
- Fixed 3 stale /documents/ paths in existing memory
- **File Watcher** (chokidar, in-process): watches /home/lobster/projects recursively,
  debounced 500ms, ignores node_modules/.git/build. On delete → marks refs broken.
  On add → fuzzy-match auto-fix of broken refs.
- **Memory Validator**: extracts file paths from memory content via regex, registers
  in memory_references, validates against filesystem every 30 min. Auto-corrects
  renamed files via recursive search (depth 3). UNIQUE constraint prevents dupes.
- **Intellect API** (/api/v1/intellect/*):
  - GET /context?project=X — scoped memory for CLI injection (markdown)
  - GET /events — recent Intellect decisions
  - GET /stream — SSE live stream
  - POST /validate — manual trigger
  - GET /stats — ref counts + event counts + episodes
- **Session Hook Fixed** (~/.claude/hooks/porter-session-start.js): queries Intellect
  API directly, detects project from cwd, no more stale paths.
- **UI**: Intellect section on Intelligence page (/intelligence in sidebar under Ops)
  — stats cards, live event stream (polls every 5s), manual validate button.

**Key files:**
- backend/src/services/intellect/file-watcher.ts
- backend/src/services/intellect/memory-validator.ts
- backend/src/routes/v1/intellect.ts
- backend/src/db/migrate-intellect-v1.ts
- admin/frontend/app/routes/intelligence.tsx (added Porter Intellect section at top)
- ~/.claude/hooks/porter-session-start.js

**MIPT Research Insight (critical for Phase 2+):**
Protocol choice explains 44% of quality variation. Model choice only 14%.
Sequential protocol (agents see predecessor outputs, choose own roles) beats all.
Pre-assigned roles HURT performance with capable models. Kill fixed-role personas
(Vigil, Compass, etc.) as coordination model. 3-ingredient recipe: mission + protocol
+ capable model. Porter's job = choose the right PROTOCOL per task. Agent memory
tracks emergent patterns, not assigned identities.

## Porter Intellect — Phase 2 SHIPPED (2026-04-09)

**Learning layer live. Porter now learns from every CLI session.**

- **Correction Detector** (intellect/correction-detector.ts): pattern-matches user
  messages ("never", "don't", "always", "stop", "wrong", "instead"). Noise filter
  rejects questions. Creates directive candidates (status='candidate', priority=60).
  Similarity dedupe (shared significant words ≥70%) reinforces existing candidates
  with +10 priority instead of duplicating.
- **Session Analyzer** (intellect/session-analyzer.ts): creates episodes from
  bridge_dispatch_log + intellect_events. Synthesizes summary (project, dispatch
  count, duration, top tools, corrections, files changed). Idempotent per session.
  sweepStaleSessions() catches sessions that ended without a SessionEnd hook.
- **Memory Promoter** (intellect/memory-promoter.ts): promotes candidates at
  priority ≥ 80 (= 2 reinforcements) to status='active' with verified_at timestamp.
  Archives unreinforced candidates older than 14 days.
- **Dispatch Scorer** (intellect/dispatch-scorer.ts): heuristic outcome scoring
  for unscored dispatches. Latency + token ratio + correction proximity (−1.0 if
  a correction fired within 90s after the dispatch). Warms routing-confidence
  cache after each pass. Ran clean on first pass: 500 scored (482/8/10).
- **Workflow Engine** (intellect/workflow-engine.ts): minimal event-driven runner.
  Reads workflows table, fires on emitEvent() or runScheduledWorkflows(tag).
  6 built-in workflows seeded at startup: session_analyze, sweep_stale_sessions,
  memory_validate, memory_promote, dispatch_score, correction→promote.
- **Phase 2 API endpoints** (/api/v1/intellect):
  - POST /correction — submit user message for detection
  - POST /session-end — create episode + emit session.end event
  - POST /promote — run memory promoter manually
  - POST /score-dispatches — run dispatch scorer manually
  - GET /candidates — list pending directive candidates
  - POST /candidates/:id/accept — manual promotion (priority=90, status=active)
  - POST /candidates/:id/reject — archive candidate
  - GET /episodes — recent episodes (optional project filter)
- **New CLI hooks** in ~/.claude/settings.json:
  - UserPromptSubmit → porter-user-prompt.js → POST /correction
  - SessionEnd → porter-session-end.js → POST /session-end
- **Intelligence UI**: Intellect section extended with
  - 6-cell stats row (refs/valid/broken/directives/candidates/episodes)
  - Directive candidates list (accept/dismiss inline, Run promoter button)
  - Recent episodes list
  - Event stream recognizes new event types (correction_detected/reinforced,
    directive_promoted/archived, episode_created, dispatch_scored, workflow_ran/failed)

**Verified end-to-end (2026-04-09):**
1. POST correction → candidate created (priority 60)
2. Reinforcement POST → priority bumped to 70
3. Reinforcement POST → priority 80 → correction.detected event →
   memory_promote workflow fired → candidate promoted to active in one loop
4. dispatch-scorer ran: 500 dispatches scored, routing-confidence cache refreshed

**Phase 3 NEXT — Autonomy:**

**Phase 3 — Autonomy:**
Memory pruner (daily cleanup), agent evolution (NOT role-based — pattern-based
per MIPT), pattern mining from promoted corrections, custom workflow
composition, Intellect self-monitoring (are memories getting used? are
corrections decreasing over time?).

**Phase 4 — Dashboard overhaul (LAST):**
Replace static dashboard with living intelligence view.

**Plan file:** /home/lobster/.claude/plans/rosy-frolicking-hedgehog.md

## Queued Work (from pre-Intellect era — lower priority now)
1. Lifecycle hook system (Pre/PostDispatch events for automation)
2. Concurrent tool execution for workers
3. Notification folding + priority queue
4. Agent status shimmer/pulse animations
5. Replace hardcoded revenue curves with real billing data
